# ||**Some of My Hackerrank Codes**||

<h3> I write at least one code on Hackerrank everyday. Sometimes I love how efficiently my code is. These are my best codes (in my opinion :upside_down_face: ).
When i upload a code i will update the readme file and add a description of the code. The descriptions are below. </h3>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## -> hex-oct-dec-bin.py

It gets an input (an integer). Then writes the hexadecimal, octal, decimal and binary forms of all the numbers until input number (including input number).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## -> set-operations.py

The code gets an input as a set of numbers (we create a set object with them). Then it allows user to do specific number of operations. Operations are 'pop', 'remove', 'discard'. These are some of the set object methods.
