# ||**Some of My Hackerrank Codes**||

<h3> I write at least one code on Hackerrank everyday. Sometimes I love how efficiently my code is. These are my best codes (in my opinion :upside_down_face: ).
When i upload a code i will update the readme file and add a description of the code. The descriptions are below. </h3>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## -> CaptainRoom.py

It gets a list of room numbers as an input.

There are an unknown group of families consisting of k members per group (where k is not equal 1) and also there is the captain! The Captain was given a separate room, and the rest were given one room per group. We have an unordered list of randomly arranged room entries. The list consists of the room numbers for all of the tourists. The room numbers will appear k times per group except for the Captain's room. The code finds the captain's room from the list.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## -> hex-oct-dec-bin.py

It gets an input (an integer). Then writes the hexadecimal, octal, decimal and binary forms of all the numbers until input number (including input number).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## -> set-operations.py

The code gets an input as a set of numbers (we create a set object with them). Then it allows user to do specific number of operations. Operations are 'pop', 'remove', 'discard'. These are some of the set object methods.

## -> find-mbc-angle.py

Input format: The first line contains the length of side AB. The second line contains the length of side BC.

Output format: Output the angle MBC in degrees. (Note: Round the angle to the nearest integer.)
